&lt;p>Suppose we have three long magnetic tapes, each containing a list of names in alphabetical order. The first list contains the names of people woring at IBM Yorktown, the second the names of students at Columbia University and the third the names of people on welfare in New York City. Practically speaking, all three lists are endless, so no upper bounds are given. It is known that at least one person is on all three lists. Write a program to locate the first such person (the one with the alphabetically smallest person).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
